# Capsule Networks Tutorial
This is a tutorial for Capsule Networks covering the base models, some extensions and some applications

## Implimentation
1. Here are the implimentations of two papers Dynamic Routing Between Capsules and Matrix Capsules with EM Routing using pytorch with python3, installation script of which is already added at the top of the respective python files.
2. It's recommandaed to use ipython ide(e.g. jupyter), in which the ipynb file can easily be imported.
